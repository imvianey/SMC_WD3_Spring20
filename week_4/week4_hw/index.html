                    Opportunity, also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover – B) or MER-1, and nicknamed "Oppy", is
                    a robotic rover that was active on Mars from 2004 until the middle of 2018. Launched on July 7,
                    2003, as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25,
                    2004, three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A) touched down on the other side of the planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a planned 90-sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 Earth days), Spirit functioned
                    until it got stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while Opportunity was able to stay
                    operational for 5111 sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual
                    recharging of its batteries using solar power, and hibernating during events such as dust storms to
                    save power. This careful operation allowed Opportunity to exceed its operating plan by 14 years, 46
                    days (in Earth time), 55 times its designed lifespan. By June 10, 2018, when it last contacted
                    NASA, the rover had traveled a distance of 45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mission highlights included the initial 90-sol mission, finding extramartian meteorites such as Heat
                    Shield Rock (Meridiani Planum meteorite), and over two years of exploring and studying Victoria
                    crater. The rover survived moderate dust storms and in 2011 reached Endeavour crater, which has been
                    described as a "second landing site". The Opportunity mission is considered one of NASA's most
                    successful ventures.
                </p>
                <p class="lead">“And when that day arrives, some portion of that first footprint will be owned by the
                    men and women of Opportunity, and a little rover that defied the odds and did so much in the name of
                    exploration."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the planetary 2018 dust storm on Mars, Opportunity ceased communications on June 10 and
                    entered hibernation on June 12, 2018. It was hoped it would reboot once the weather cleared, but
                    it did not, suggesting either a catastrophic failure or that a layer of dust had covered its solar
                    panels. NASA hoped to re-establish contact with the rover, citing a windy period that could
                    potentially clean off its solar panels. On February 13, 2019, NASA officials declared that the
                    Opportunity mission was complete, after the spacecraft had failed to respond to over 1,000 signals
                    sent since August 2018.

Martian soil is the fine regolith found on the surface of Mars. Its properties can differ significantly from those of terrestrial soil, including its toxicity due to the presence of perchlorates. The term Martian soil typically refers to the finer fraction of regolith.
